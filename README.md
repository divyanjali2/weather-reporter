   git clone https://github.com/divyanjali2/weather-reporter.git
   cd weather-reporter-website
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies and composer

   ```

## Working with SCSS

The project uses SCSS for styling. The SCSS files are located in the `assets/scss` directory.

### SCSS File Structure

```
assets/scss/
├── _variables.scss    # Global variables
├── _overrides.scss   # Bootstrap overrides
├── _responsive.scss  # Media queries
├── _style.scss      # Main styles
└── main.scss        # Entry point
```

### Compiling SCSS

1. Install SASS globally if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g sass
   ```

2. To compile SCSS once:
   ```bash
   sass assets/scss/main.scss assets/css/main.css
   ```

3. To watch for changes and compile automatically:
   ```bash
   sass --watch assets/scss:assets/css --style expanded
   ```
